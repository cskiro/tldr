Sarah Johnson: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining our Q4 planning meeting. We have a lot to cover today so let's jump right in.

Mike Chen: Before we start, I wanted to mention that the customer feedback from last quarter was really positive. The new dashboard feature is getting great reviews.

Sarah Johnson: That's excellent news Mike. Let's make sure we capture that in our quarterly report. Moving on to our main agenda items.

Lisa Rodriguez: I've been analyzing our sprint performance metrics. We're consistently delivering about 85% of our planned story points, which is actually pretty good, but I think we can do better.

Mike Chen: What do you think is causing the 15% shortfall? 

Lisa Rodriguez: Mainly scope creep during development and some underestimation on the backend tasks. I propose we add a 20% buffer to our estimates going forward.

Sarah Johnson: That sounds reasonable. Mike, can you work with Lisa to implement that estimation buffer for next sprint?

Mike Chen: Absolutely, I'll coordinate with Lisa this week to revise our planning process.

Alex Kim: On the technical side, we need to address the database performance issues. The reports are taking too long to load, especially for enterprise customers.

Sarah Johnson: How critical is this Alex?

Alex Kim: Very critical. We've had three enterprise customers complain this month. I recommend we prioritize the database optimization work for next sprint.

Lisa Rodriguez: I agree with Alex. The performance issues are becoming a blocker for our sales team too.

Sarah Johnson: Okay, let's make database optimization our top priority for next sprint. Alex, can you prepare a technical spec by Friday?

Alex Kim: Yes, I'll have the spec ready by Friday and I'll include time estimates for the optimization work.

Mike Chen: We should also consider hiring another backend developer to help with this workload.

Sarah Johnson: Good point. I'll discuss the hiring need with HR and see what budget we have available.

Lisa Rodriguez: For our immediate next steps, should we schedule a technical review meeting for early next week?

Sarah Johnson: Yes, let's schedule that for Tuesday. Alex will present the technical spec and we'll finalize the sprint priorities.

Mike Chen: Sounds good. I'll send out calendar invites for Tuesday at 2 PM.

Sarah Johnson: Perfect. Before we wrap up, are there any other concerns or blockers we need to address?

Alex Kim: Just one thing - we need approval for the new monitoring tools we discussed last month. They'll help us catch performance issues earlier.

Sarah Johnson: I'll fast-track that approval. Expect an answer by end of week.

Lisa Rodriguez: That would be great. The monitoring tools will definitely help with our proactive approach.

Sarah Johnson: Excellent. Let me summarize our key decisions: database optimization is top priority, Alex will deliver the tech spec by Friday, we're scheduling a technical review for Tuesday, and I'm pursuing approval for monitoring tools and discussing backend hiring with HR.

Mike Chen: That covers everything. Thanks everyone for a productive meeting.

Sarah Johnson: Thanks everyone. Let's reconvene Tuesday and keep the momentum going.
