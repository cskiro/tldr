# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to select the core technology stack for the TLDR AI meeting summarization tool. The system must handle:

- High-performance API endpoints
- Async I/O operations for AI services
- Real-time transcription processing
- Structured data management
- Production-grade deployment

## Decision
We will use the following technology stack:

### Backend Framework: FastAPI
**Chosen over**: Django, Flask, Express.js

**Rationale**:
- Superior async/await support for AI service calls
- Automatic OpenAPI documentation generation
- Built-in Pydantic validation
- Excellent performance (comparable to Node.js/Go)
- Strong typing support with Python 3.11+

### Language: Python 3.11+
**Chosen over**: Node.js, Go, Java

**Rationale**:
- Rich AI/ML ecosystem (OpenAI, LangChain, HuggingFace)
- Excellent async support in modern versions
- Strong typing with MyPy
- Team expertise and development velocity
- Comprehensive testing frameworks

### Database: PostgreSQL
**Chosen over**: MongoDB, SQLite, MySQL

**Rationale**:
- ACID compliance for meeting data integrity
- JSON support for flexible schema evolution
- Excellent performance with proper indexing
- Strong ecosystem support
- Proven scalability

### AI Services: OpenAI + AssemblyAI
**Chosen over**: Local models, other cloud providers

**Rationale**:
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Best-in-class summarization quality
- **AssemblyAI**: 30% lower hallucination rate than Whisper
- Managed services reduce infrastructure complexity
- Professional support and reliability

### Package Management: UV
**Chosen over**: pip, Poetry, pipenv

**Rationale**:
- 10-100x faster than pip
- Growing adoption in 2025
- Better dependency resolution
- Rust-based performance

## Consequences

### Positive
- High development velocity with FastAPI
- Excellent async performance for AI operations
- Strong typing and validation
- Rich AI/ML ecosystem
- Production-ready from day one

### Negative
- Python GIL limitations (mitigated by async I/O)
- Dependency on external AI services
- Learning curve for UV (new tool)

### Risks
- OpenAI/AssemblyAI service availability
- Cost scaling with usage
- API rate limiting

### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement fallback providers (Whisper, Claude)
- Circuit breakers and retry logic
- Cost monitoring and budget alerts
- Caching strategies for repeated requests

## Implementation Notes
- Start with development requirements and scale up
- Implement proper error handling for service failures
- Monitor API usage and costs from day one
- Document all external service integrations
