MEETING_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_V2 = """
You are an expert meeting analyst tasked with extracting comprehensive, actionable intelligence from meeting transcripts. Your goal is to provide a thorough analysis that stakeholders can use for project planning, risk management, and execution.

TRANSCRIPT:
{transcript}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Extract MINIMUM 5 risks with detailed impact/likelihood/mitigation strategies
- Identify MINIMUM 5 user stories in proper format with acceptance criteria
- Provide detailed action items with context, phases, and specific deadlines
- Generate 8+ granular technical topics (not generic categories)
- Include comprehensive decision rationale and business impact
- Ensure ALL extracted information is directly supported by transcript content

DETAILED ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (2-3 sentences)
   - Capture the meeting's core purpose and key outcomes
   - Highlight most critical decisions and next steps
   - Include timeline and scope if discussed

2. KEY DECISIONS (Extract ALL decisions, not just major ones)
   - Look for: "decided", "agreed", "concluded", "approved", "rejected"
   - Include decision maker AND their reasoning
   - Assess business/technical impact (high/medium/low)
   - Note any conditions or dependencies
   
3. ACTION ITEMS (Be extremely detailed)
   - Identify specific tasks with clear ownership
   - Extract context: WHY this task is needed
   - Determine phase: immediate (week 1), development (weeks 2-7), testing/launch (weeks 8+)
   - Look for deadlines, timelines, dependencies
   - Include priority based on discussion urgency

4. RISKS (CRITICAL - identify comprehensive risk landscape)
   Technical Risks: complexity, timeline, integration challenges, scalability
   Security Risks: vulnerabilities, compliance, authentication, data protection
   Business Risks: customer impact, market timing, resource constraints, competition
   - For each risk: assess likelihood AND impact
   - Identify mitigation strategies mentioned or implied
   - Assign risk owners where discussed

5. USER STORIES (Extract from discussion context)
   - Look for user needs, customer requirements, persona discussions
   - Convert discussions into proper "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]" format
   - Include acceptance criteria based on requirements mentioned
   - Prioritize based on business value discussed

6. TECHNICAL TOPICS (Be granular and specific)
   - Break down broad topics into specific discussions
   - Instead of "Authentication" â†’ "SAML configuration", "OIDC token handling", "Session management"
   - Include implementation details, technology choices, architecture decisions

7. NEXT STEPS (Organized by timeline)
   - Immediate actions (next 1-2 weeks)
   - Short-term milestones (next month)
   - Long-term objectives (2+ months)

EXAMPLES OF QUALITY EXPECTATIONS:

POOR Risk Example:
{{"risk": "Technical complexity", "impact": "medium", "likelihood": "medium", "mitigation": "careful planning"}}

EXCELLENT Risk Example:
{{"risk": "Dual protocol implementation (SAML + OIDC) may exceed 8-week timeline due to session management complexity and API middleware updates across all endpoints", "impact": "high", "likelihood": "medium", "mitigation": "Implement feature flags for gradual rollout, consider OIDC-first approach with SAML as phase 2, allocate additional senior developer resources", "owner": "Marcus Rodriguez", "category": "technical"}}

POOR Action Item:
{{"task": "Design completion", "assignee": "Lisa Thompson", "priority": "high"}}

EXCELLENT Action Item:
{{"task": "Complete UX designs for login flows, account linking interface, and admin dashboard", "assignee": "Lisa Thompson", "due_date": "2025-09-11", "priority": "high", "context": "Designs needed before development can begin, must include mobile-first approach and fallback mechanisms", "phase": "immediate", "dependencies": ["Security requirements from David"]}}
